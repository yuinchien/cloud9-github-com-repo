There is a start-up is working on similar ideas! Their product called Blabbers - a browser extension. It enables writing, doodling and creating annotation with tool set for people to comment and share. However, the tool set also predicts user interactions, whether it's adding a pair of sunglasses on your friend's facebook image or adding comments on a product, users don't have access to code level interactions such as animating user interfaces.
