What I love about graffiti is the immediate magic of transforming the urban landscape into a narrative or imagination which enables people to initiate dialogues. I also think the spirit of creating art work in an almost rebellious way also speaks a lot about our contemporary generation. Since our generation is about the Web, I wonder if it could provide corners and walls for people to perform self-expression as in the urban world. What would be the analogies of bricks and concrete in the virtual space? What's affordances of the medium that's unique for self-expression or vandalism?
