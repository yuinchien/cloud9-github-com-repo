“To radically shift regime behavior we must think clearly and boldly for if we have learned anything, it is that regimes do not want to be changed. We must think beyond those who have gone before us, and discover technological changes that embolden us with ways to act in which our forebears could not. Firstly we must understand what aspect of government or neocorporatist behavior we wish to change or remove. Secondly we must develop a way of thinking about this behavior that is strong enough carry us through the mire of politically distorted language, and into a position of clarity. Finally must use these insights to inspire within us and others a course of ennobling, and effective action.” - Julian Assange, “State and Terrorist Conspiracies” ("via":http://zunguzungu.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/julian-assange-and-the-computer-conspiracy-%E2%80%9Cto-destroy-this-invisible-government%E2%80%9D/)

I can't help like this guy, the idea of *reversing conspiracy* is exhilarating. Why should governments and secret organizations justify their concealing judgements and actions from the general public while we the citizen, the people are responsible for taking the consequences for their conduct? How do we form our judgement and trust in politics in the sea of different ideologies from the press, politicians, journalists, and authorities? There can only be one truth, and most of the time it is not told. Why are confidential documents so provoking? Is it because they reveal the truth or conspiracy? If reversing conspiracy can reform authorities and speak the truth like no other means can achieve, I vote for it. 

And, personally I think the sex crime accusation of Julian Assange is more of a scam in order to distract people's attention to his motivation behind the project and the aftereffects of WikiLeaks.
