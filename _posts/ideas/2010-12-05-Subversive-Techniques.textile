In my experiments I applied these subversive strategies in my work.

To erase, can we eliminate the unwanted and reclaim our own space

To disassemble, can we break the existing grid and change the composition of a webpage dynamically?

Spy, being online is a very private activity, if thereâ€™s someone watching you, will you think and behave differently?

Crack
Kids like to tag their name and leave traces whenever they visit a place, what if people are able to leave traces on a webpage like cracking a wall when they click a button?

Inflect
Can a textfield be more than a textfield? Can it possess human imperfections and qualities that would bring more life to it instead of being a component? 

To Overwrite
What if you can develop your own visual style of the websites, and even write your own messages on them? 

Now, I am gonna demo the work based on these strategies.
