* *TAG* is the most basic writing of an artist's name - writer's personalized signature.

* *PISSING* is the act of taking a refillable fire extinguisher and replacing the contents inside with paint.

* *THROW-UP* also known as a *BOMBING* which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed.

* *PIECE* is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors.

* *BLOCKBUSTER* or *ROLLER* is a large piece, almost always done in a block shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colours, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.

* *WILDSTYLE* is a more complex style form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points.
