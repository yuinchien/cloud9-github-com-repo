I was very interested in people swearing. It was mysterious to me that why my friends swear often seem very funny, while many situations swear words can have very negative connotation. In Steven Pinker's book "(external) The Stuff of Thought":http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/stuff/index.html, he talks about how our mind works psychologically when we use language to express ourself and also how brain process language, he also introduces the five types of swearing: *Abusive*, *Cathartic*, *Dysphemism*, *Emphatic* and *Idiomatic*. I was digging into the book "Catcher In The Rye" trying to identify the 5 types of swearing specifically used, and there was a moment I suddenly realized that we the the Gen Yers, are the the epitome of Holden! A major of People in our generation are depressed, and anxious about the future, about who they are. My psychology teacher pointed out that TECHNOLOGY might be a key issue.

I also found that it's interesting to look at sub-standard buildings(building code violations) as a metaphor for swearing. In their own universe, they are a lot of commons. For the benefit and safety of general people, these are the violations, but they are everywhere. You can not kill them.

If substandard building is the visual equivalence of swearing, what does the landscape of public voice look like? Graffiti perhaps. I wonder if the virtual space should embody the same environment for self-expression.
