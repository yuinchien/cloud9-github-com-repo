Where Did The Web Come From?
If our generation is about the web, then we must start by examining how did the web originate from, and who started the vision of creating browser to render webpages.

The idea originate from CERN by a researcher named Tim Berners-Lee whose original goal was for researchers to use and share documents. He initiated the HTML markup system and wrote the first browser and server software in the late1990. This is a screenshot of Tim’s desktop ran on the NeXTStep Operating system running his browser. Of course, in the past 10 years, web has revolutionized tremendously.

Today Browsers are essentially the “construction companies” who build the architectural landscape in web space - they render websites and allow interactions to happen. This is a simplified graph showcasing the 4 major browsers today,they are powered by different browser engines which are Trident, Gecko and Webkit. Web standards have been pushed by several dominating corporations while they are shaping the definition of a webpage, the digital landscape is constantly being redefined by the new standards.

However, what standards bring is conformity, and conformity brings uniform thinking and single perspective of things.

Why should billions of user look at the same google page every single day? Yes, they change the logo but it’s visually so generic and I don’t believe there is one single universal design that could serve all human kind. The same situations apply to facebook and twitter, these social websites have been dominating our live, without facebook you are being socially dysfunctional. These giant cooperations try to put their hand in every aspect of our live, with their universal websites that look repetitive and 	standardized.

The other distracting web element is the advertisements, wherever you go there’s ads shouting at you, when you trying to read news, watch a video, or buying a pair of shoes. Yet, these ads are put up there by companies who paid money and claim to own the space, and user are force to live with them without the chance to say no.
