I am intrigued by the behavior of swearing through funny personal experience. It was a shocking moment to me, when I found myself unconsciously spitting out words like "shit" in public (which I don't normally do), after being surrounded by people using dirty words as expletives in daily conversation for weeks. To my surprise, my reaction toward their swearing habit was rather amusing than offended. The fact that a sentence being spiced with a few f-words turned out to be hilarious to me. However, the unconscious shift in my own speaking behavior was something shocking and unexpected.
