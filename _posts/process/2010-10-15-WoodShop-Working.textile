Trying to unscrew the table saw blade for cutting small edges on the wood panel. Working in the WoodShop always shatters my innocence of taking things for granted, and having the saw dust splashing over my body helps dissolve some of my _digitness_. I respect carpenter from the bottom of my heart, I really do.
