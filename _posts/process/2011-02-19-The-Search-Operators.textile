Keyword Input Operator: Surina
Search Operator: Jarek
Lucky Search Operator: Remo

In another parallel Universe, cyber space is not quite the same. Surina the Keyword Input Operator is notorious for her bad work ethic. No one in the Google Web Search Department want to co-operate with her, let alone the customers who often complain about her miserable service. Today is the first day of work for Jarek and Remo the twin brothers who just join the department. They are assigned to work with Surina as a team to serve customersâ€™ search requests. While Jarek functions as the Search Operator, Remo is the Lucky Search Operator. It is a very demanding situation for the twins to perform their duties together with Surina, who yawns uncontrollably and carelessly at work. She constantly produces yawning noises, and pushes the twins away with her wide open mouth. Jarek and Remo wish Surina is only a nightmare, and they will soon wake up and break free of this endless repetition.
