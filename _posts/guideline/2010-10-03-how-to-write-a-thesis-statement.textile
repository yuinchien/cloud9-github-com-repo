title: What is a Thesis Statement?

tags:

---

p. Thesis statement needs to answer a question about the issue you want to explore. Define your question, and answer it. It should be one- or two-sentence *condensation* of the argument.

A good thesis statement should include the following attributes:

* take on a subject on which reasonable people could disagree
* deal with a subject can be *adequately* treated
* express *one* main idea
* assert your conclusions about a subject
* narrow the topic
* Take a position on the topic
* Use specific language
* Make an assertion based on clearly stated support
* Show that the topic is *controversial* to contrast your strong points
