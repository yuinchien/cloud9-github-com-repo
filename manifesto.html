	<ol>
		<li>Always do more than you are expected to do.</li>
		<li>Don't be a wannabe. You are special, and you are good at something.</li>
		<li>You won't live forever, so do what you think is right.</li>
		<li>Be a good time manager. All-nighter is evil and unnecessary.</li>
		<li>You choose what you do because it makes you happy.</li>
		<li>Nobody hates you. Maybe you are just not good enough... yet.</li>
